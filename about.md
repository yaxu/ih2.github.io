*Inhabiting the Hack* is a collaborative research project examining
the notions of innovation and creativity ingrained in digital
culture. We will work with arts organisations in developing
alternative styles of hack events, often informed by traditional arts
activities such as residencies and retreats. The hacks all privilege
diversity, collaboration and reflection, and are positioned in
alternative and complementary disciplines and histories, provide a
critical perspective on current practice.

* What relationships between innovation, practice, imagination and material does the hackathon uncover? How do maker cultures reorder these relationships, and to what extent does enhanced tangibility and liveness in digital interfaces interfere with or promote innovation?
* Where does innovation need to be located in the design process (is it located in the design process?) in order to be captured, exploited, made meaningful? Is innovation as it is produced here, necessarily a good thing?
* What future does the hackathon imagine? What potentials for innovation and creativity are suggested?

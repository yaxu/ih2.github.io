        <title>Uncanny Valley</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Uncanny Valley was a 2-3 day group residency organised by LoveBytes
Sheffield, bringing digital artists out into the Peak District to
respond to the environment. Burbage Valley is a beautiful, rugged
post-industrial landscape, a bowl surrounded by gritstone edge, marked
by disused quarries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felicity Ford, Antonio Roberts, Tim Shaw, Shelly Knotts and Alex
McLean worked without particular brief, using the opportunity to
retreat, reflect on their own practice and allow new ideas to develop
through collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short documentary film&lt;/h1&gt;

        <title>Sonic Pattern</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sonicpattern.com/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pattern and the Textility of Code&lt;/a&gt; is
a series of events (symposia, performances, exhibitions) curated by
Karen Gaskill (who until 2016 lead the Innovation strand of the Crafts
Council) and Alex McLean. Through these events we bring people working
variously with threads, sound and code together, for discussion and
practice focussing on the cultural-technological role of pattern in
their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Inhabiting the Hack series, we joined with the AHRC
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kairotic.org&quot;&gt;Weaving Codes, Coding Weaves&lt;/a&gt; project and Crafts
Council to fund a symposium, evening of performances and group
residency.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Media Labs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/DML5-small.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalmedialabs.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Media Labs&lt;/a&gt; was one of the
major inspirations for Inhabiting the Hack, and so we were very happy
to include one of their residencies in our programme. In the words of
one of the organiser-curators of the hack, Benedict Phillips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the success of Digital Media Labs 2014, it seemed inevitable
that there would be another one and with the support of new project
partners, Inhabiting The Hack and the Communities and Culture
Network+, our 2015 edition ‘Digital Outsiders’ came into being.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With the third iteration of Digital Media Labs, we created a
conceptual structure around the theme of the &amp;lsquo;digital outsider,
providing a starting point or provocation for the participating
artists to explore if they wished. The concept of the &#39;digital
outsider&amp;rsquo; first suggests the question of &#39;are you on the outside or
the inside?&amp;rsquo;. Thinking about the notion of the digital outsider for us
was about taking a distinctly personal perspective from which to
examine the digital world and that which is thought of as being
&#39;outside&amp;rsquo; of the digital. Are your ideas digitally inclusive or
digitally exclusive?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Digital Media Labs is a focused opportunity for professional artists
from a variety of career stages to reflect upon how they present their
ideas, how they communicate these to others and how they deal with
those ideas when challenged. It is an opportunity to forget who you
are, with many of the day-to-day responsibilities and barriers that
impinge on making work removed. We are interested in what happens when
artists have the normal restraints removed and have to battle through
the uncertainty of being able to do whatever you want.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We have often found that Digital Media Labs can generate a lot of
questioning and disorientation within the artists who take part. But
from our experience, it is only from this point of view that you can
start to find your way out. As we say at the Lab: &#39;If you&amp;rsquo;re not lost,
how are you going to find yourself!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benedict Phillips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Media Labs 2015 participating artists were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radames Anja, Tim Brunsden, Toni Buckby, Adam Cooper, Gina Czarnecki,
Monika Dutta, Hwa Young Jung, Shelly Knotts, Gemma May Latham and
James Medd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Media Labs Team: Benedict Phillips, Dave Lynch, Glenn Boulter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from: Ross Dalziel, Ben Dalton, Alan Pergusey, Alex McLean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominators 2015: FACT, CRUMB, Re:Dock, Sound Network, Access Space,
Superposition, Inhabiting the Hack / Alex McLean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was made possible with support from Arts Council England,
Communities and Culture Network+ and Octopus Collective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wrekshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This hack was a &amp;ldquo;Wrekshop&amp;rdquo; lead by performance artist Paul Granjon,
taking redundant technology apart, and reconstructing it as something
new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Granjon is an electronic artist who makes robots and other
machines for performances and installations. Paul is interested in the
co-evolution of humans and machines. A fervent advocate of creative
techno making fun, he believes that people need to get their hands
dirty with technology, understand that it is crucial to consume less
of it and know more about how it works. He disseminates his ideas and
unique upcycling techniques in Wrekshops that involve people,
electronic waste, digital fabrication and open-source electronics. He
is currently working on a song on electricity, to be performed
off-grid. In collaboration with Access Space as well as Paul Granjon.&lt;/p&gt;

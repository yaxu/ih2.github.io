[Sonic Pattern and the Textility of Code](http://sonicpattern.com/) is
a series of events (symposia, performances, exhibitions) curated by
Karen Gaskill (who until 2016 lead the Innovation strand of the Crafts
Council) and Alex McLean. Through these events we bring people working
variously with threads, sound and code together, for discussion and
practice focussing on the cultural-technological role of pattern in
their work.

As part of the Inhabiting the Hack series, we joined with the AHRC
[Weaving Codes, Coding Weaves](http://kairotic.org) project and Crafts
Council to fund a symposium, evening of performances and group
residency.

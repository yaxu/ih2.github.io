[Digital Media Labs](http://digitalmedialabs.org/) was one of the
major inspirations for Inhabiting the Hack, and so we were very happy
to include one of their residencies in our programme. In the words of
one of the organiser-curators of the hack, Benedict Phillips:

<blockquote><p>After the success of Digital Media Labs 2014, it seemed inevitable
that there would be another one and with the support of new project
partners, Inhabiting The Hack and the Communities and Culture
Network+, our 2015 edition ‘Digital Outsiders’ came into being.
</p><p>
With the third iteration of Digital Media Labs, we created a
conceptual structure around the theme of the 'digital outsider,
providing a starting point or provocation for the participating
artists to explore if they wished. The concept of the 'digital
outsider' first suggests the question of 'are you on the outside or
the inside?'. Thinking about the notion of the digital outsider for us
was about taking a distinctly personal perspective from which to
examine the digital world and that which is thought of as being
'outside' of the digital. Are your ideas digitally inclusive or
digitally exclusive?
</p><p>
Digital Media Labs is a focused opportunity for professional artists
from a variety of career stages to reflect upon how they present their
ideas, how they communicate these to others and how they deal with
those ideas when challenged. It is an opportunity to forget who you
are, with many of the day-to-day responsibilities and barriers that
impinge on making work removed. We are interested in what happens when
artists have the normal restraints removed and have to battle through
the uncertainty of being able to do whatever you want.
</p><p>
We have often found that Digital Media Labs can generate a lot of
questioning and disorientation within the artists who take part. But
from our experience, it is only from this point of view that you can
start to find your way out. As we say at the Lab: 'If you're not lost,
how are you going to find yourself!'</p>
<p><strong>Benedict Phillips</strong></p>

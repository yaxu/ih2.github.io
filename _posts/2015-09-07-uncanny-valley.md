Uncanny Valley was a 2-3 day group residency organised by LoveBytes
Sheffield, bringing digital artists out into the Peak District to
respond to the environment. Burbage Valley is a beautiful, rugged
post-industrial landscape, a bowl surrounded by gritstone edge, marked
by disused quarries.

Felicity Ford, Antonio Roberts, Tim Shaw, Shelly Knotts and Alex
McLean worked without particular brief, using the opportunity to
retreat, reflect on their own practice and allow new ideas to develop
through collaboration.

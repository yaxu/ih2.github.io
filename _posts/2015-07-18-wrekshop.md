This hack was a "Wrekshop" lead by performance artist Paul Granjon,
taking redundant technology apart, and reconstructing it as something
new.

Paul Granjon is an electronic artist who makes robots and other
machines for performances and installations. Paul is interested in the
co-evolution of humans and machines. A fervent advocate of creative
techno making fun, he believes that people need to get their hands
dirty with technology, understand that it is crucial to consume less
of it and know more about how it works. He disseminates his ideas and
unique upcycling techniques in Wrekshops that involve people,
electronic waste, digital fabrication and open-source electronics. He
is currently working on a song on electricity, to be performed
off-grid. In collaboration with Access Space as well as Paul Granjon.
